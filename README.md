# TwitterBot
Creating the foundation for a fully operational Twitter bot that will auto-tweet to an account. This project will update and become more advanced as I learn.

# Setup
- For this project to work, users must first create a developer account with Twitter https://developer.twitter.com/
- Following the creating and such of the developer account, for a new project, you must generate the relevent keys to be used for the application to interact with the Twitter account.
- You must then insert the relevant keys and secrets into the `Config.cs` class to ensure that your account can be properly linked.

## NOTE:
This is simply a console-based application for the automation of sending tweets. Another project will be created with a dashboard-like graphical user interface in the future.
